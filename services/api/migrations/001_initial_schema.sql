-- Migration: Initial Schema Documentation
-- Date: 2025-01-02
-- Description: Document current schema - no changes needed

-- Current notes table structure is already optimal:
-- - Uses JSONB for soap field which can store any SOAP note structure
-- - Includes synthesized_summary, confidence_score, goals_addressed, etc. as JSON
-- - No separate columns needed - JSONB provides flexibility

-- Example of current SOAP note structure in JSONB:
/*
{
  "subjective": "Client reports...",
  "objective": "Client demonstrated...", 
  "assessment": "Client shows...",
  "plan": "Continue with...",
  "synthesized_summary": "Client showed positive engagement...",
  "confidence_score": 0.95,
  "goals_addressed": ["Improve coordination", "Increase strength"],
  "next_session_recommendations": ["Continue exercises", "Add resistance"]
}
*/

-- No ALTER TABLE statements needed - schema is already correct
-- Future migrations can add new tables, indexes, or modify other tables as needed
